<p>Recently I've been writing some OpenSocial gadgets for IBM Connections.  </p>
<p>IBM Connections helpfully bundles and minifies all the JavaScript resources into a single line in a single file for a smaller file size and fewer HTTP requests.  This is great for production, but somewhat limiting when you're trying to debug JavaScript.</p>
<p>If you append <strong>?debug=true</strong> to a URL, all the JavaScript files are fetched separately and unminified.</p>
<p>Use <strong>?debug=dojo</strong> to have all files concatenated, but unminified.</p>
