<p> I've been accessing a Red Hat box via Mac Screen Sharing. All was good until it started just displaying a white screen.  I assumed it was the fault of the Red Hat server, but couldn't fix it at that end. </p>
<p>It turns out that there's some kind of bug in 64-bit Screen Sharing on Snow Leopard (and maybe Lion too?), so here's the work around:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Finder, go to /System/Library/CoreServices/Screen Sharing.app</li>
<li>Right click & "Get Info" on the application</li>
<li>Check the box "Open in 32-bit mode".</li>
</ol>

<p>By the way, I'm currently running Mac OS X 10.6.8</p>
