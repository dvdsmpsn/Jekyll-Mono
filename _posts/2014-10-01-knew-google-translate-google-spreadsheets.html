<p>Well, likely loads of people, but I certainly didn't. Here's the function typed in the demo gif:</p>
<pre><code>
=GOOGLETRANSLATE($A$2, &quot;en&quot;, B2)<br />
</code></pre>
<p>That's</p>
<pre><code>
=GOOGLETRANSLATE(text, [source_language], [targetlanguage])<br />
</code></pre>
<p>This could be handy if you're into mass translating your tweets, or anything else suitably obscure.</p>
