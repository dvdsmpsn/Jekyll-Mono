<p>Each time I venture into JIRA <del>plugin</del> add-on development, I scratch around for a moment trying to remember just how JIRA page decoration works. It doesn't seem to be well documented anywhere easily accessible.</p>
<p>I normally just go back to the previous JIRA add-on I was working on and look in the <b>atlassian-plugin.xml</b> for web-sections/web-items and some velocity files for meta tags. A liberal sprinkling of these generally produces the page layout that's required for a particular job.</p>
<p>I was going to document this with screenshot and code samples, but happily stumbled upon Jobin Kuruvilla's blogpost <a href="http://www.j-tricks.com/1/post/2012/10/use-of-decorators-on-jira-pages.html">Use of decorators on JIRA pages</a>.</p>
<p>This post is now slightly out of date because of the new page layouts from JIRA 6, but the essentials hold true. It's an excellent tutorial. Nice work Jobin.</p>
