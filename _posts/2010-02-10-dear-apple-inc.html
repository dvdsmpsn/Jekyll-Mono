<p><strong>Please fix the search <acronym title="user interface">UI<acronym> in Safari on the iPhone.</acronym></acronym></strong>  </p>
<p>I've been using the iPhone for some time now and overall, the interface is really slick.  The buttons are consistently placed and this gives a really strong user experience.  Everything appears to be in the obvious place.  </p>
<p>The trouble is, I like to search the web and it looks like you've forgotten your own iPhone user interface rules for this area.<br />

<h3>Let me explain</h3>
<p>In all your other applications, the primary action button is located top-right with a secondary action button top-left.  </p>
<p><strong>Here's some examples:</strong></p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Calendar-Add-Event.png" alt="Calendar - Add Event" title="Calendar - Add Event" width="320" height="480" /></p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Mail-New-Message.png" alt="Mail - New Message" title="Mail - New Message" width="320" height="480" /></p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Safari-Basic-Authentication-dialog.png" alt="Safari Basic Authentication dialog" title="Safari Basic Authentication dialog" width="320" height="480" /></p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Messages-Edit.png" alt="Messages - Edit" title="Messages - Edit" width="320" height="480" /></p>
<p>You get the picture, right?</p>
<p>Over time the user learns this convention and without realising it assumes that the top-right button means "OK", "Submit", "Search" or whatever the primary action is.</p>
<h3>Now, let's have a look at the Safari search screen</h3>
<p>What's in the top-right button position?</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Safari-Search-Currently.png" alt="Safari Search - Currently" title="Safari Search - Currently" width="320" height="480" /></p>
<p> It's the "Cancel" button i.e. the secondary action.  </p>
<p><strong>Oh dear.  How did that get there?</strong></p>
<p>At first, I thought that I was at fault because I hadn't properly learned the interface.  Then I remembered one of the first observations you make when usability testing.  <strong>Users blame themselves</strong> for the mistakes in the design of the interface.</p>
<p>That the reason I was making the mistake so often was precisely because I <em>had</em>  learned the conventions of the user interface.</p>
<h3>So what can we do?</h3>
<p>The interface needs a subtle redesign.  Nothing major, just an increment to correct the problem.</p>
<p><strong>There are 2 options that immediately spring to mind</strong></p>
<p><strong>Option 1:</strong>  Move the Cancel button to the top-left "secondary action" position</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Safari-Search-Enhancement-Option-2.png" alt="Safari Search Enhancement - Option" title="Safari Search Enhancement - Option" width="320" height="480" /></p>
<p>This should be really easy.  The basic premise of the current design is left intact and the secondary action is returned to the correct place in the interface - the top-left position.</p>
<p><strong>Option 2:</strong> Add a "Search" button in the top-right position and move the Cancel button to the top-left "secondary action" position.</p>
<p><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Safari-Search-Enhancement-Option-1.png" alt="Safari Search Enhancement - Option" title="Safari Search Enhancement - Option" width="320" height="480" /></p>
<p>We've got an additional button now, but it's consistent with the overall design of the other apps you produce.</p>
<p>I know you're really busy right now, especially with all the activity around the iPad, but please fit this into the next version of the OS.  It is such a minor UI change, but would markedly improve the way the browser search interface works.</p>
<p>Best of luck with iPhone OS 4.0.  I hope you bundle some of <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2010/01/10/dear-apple-what-we-want-to-see-for-iphone-4-0-part-1?icid=sphere_blogsmith_inpage_tuaw">these ideas</a>, but don't worry too much about Flash.</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> If you can't manage this for me, then I'd be happy to settle for <a href="http://www.opera.com/press/releases/2010/02/10/">Opera Mini</a> being approved in the App Store instead -  I quite like the idea of being able to browse <a href="http://my.opera.com/haavard/blog/2010/02/10/opera-mini-iphone">6 times faster than Safari</a>.</p>
