<p> People have been <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/confluence%204">shouting from the rooftops</a> that Confluence 4 has finally arrived.  Despite all the hype, it's a cracking release.  I'm not going to list  all the features here, as you can find them <a href="http://atlss.in/conf40">elsewhere</a>. However I will mention one...</p>
<h2>The new editor</h2>
<p>Simply put, it's fast, slick and gorgeous looking.  It works better than any online editor I've used elsewhere.  It is a design that would <a href="http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/26979.html">make Antoine de Saint-Exup&#233;ry proud</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://davidsimpson.me/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/confluence4-editor.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/confluence4-editor-1024x786.png" alt="" title="Confluence 4 - new editor" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1154" /></a></p>
<h2>Wiki markup is dead</h2>
<p>Past experience shows that people's fondness of wiki markup is somewhat akin to that of <a href="http://www.marmite.com/">Marmite</a>.  So it seems quite a bold step to ditch this aspect of the editor for something completely new.  </p>
<h2>Long live wiki markup</h2>
<p>The good news is that behind the scenes, wiki markup is alive and well &mdash; all the new editor's great keyboard shortcuts are based off of the syntax that many people know so well.  </p>
<p>The final irony being that <b>wiki markup haters</b> may just start using wiki markup in their "faster, richer, simpler" editing experience.</p>
<p>Now, see what I mean:</p>
