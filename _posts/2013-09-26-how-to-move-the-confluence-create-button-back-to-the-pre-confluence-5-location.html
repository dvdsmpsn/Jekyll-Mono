<p>Upon release of Confluence 5, I really couldn't handle the new location for the "Create button". Â A few months in, I'm happy and it now seems natural, but for users making the change, it can seem counter-intuitive.</p>
<p>Several clients have asked how to get the create button back to where "it should be". This is a hack to do just that.</p>
<p>Browse to <strong>Confluence Admin | Look and Feel | Custom HTML | At the END of the BODY</strong> and paste the following:</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/dvdsmpsn/5728446.js"></script></p>
<p>Save and you're back to the "good old days":</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2052" style="border: 1px solid black;" title="create-relocation" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/create-relocation.png" alt="" width="518" height="149" border="1" /></p>
