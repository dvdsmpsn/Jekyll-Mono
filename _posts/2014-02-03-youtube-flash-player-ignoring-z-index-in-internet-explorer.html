<p>I recently received a bug report on one of the website I've been involved in developing. They have a fixed header and YouTube embeds were riding over the top of the head instead of tucking underneath like the rest of the content. The user's browser was Internet Explorer 10.</p>
<p>Firing up my Windows 7 VM to test this out, I couldn't replicate it on Internet Explorer versions 9 to 11, but the user was clearly experiencing this. My Internet Explorer 8 wouldn't show You Tube embeds at all. Flash was required. Installing Flash allowed the problem to appear. Flash was ignoring the z-index.</p>
<p>I had no control over how the YouTube embeds were added to the page, so a little sprinkling of JavaScript was required to fix the situation:</p>
<pre><code>
    $('iframe[src^=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed&quot;]').each(function(){<br />
        var url = $(this).attr(&quot;src&quot;);<br />
        var separator = (url.indexOf('?') &gt; 0) ? '&amp;' : '?';<br />
        $(this).attr('src', url + separator + 'wmode=transparent');<br />
    });<br />
</code></pre>
<p>This adds <b>wmode=transparent</b> to the iframe URL which in turn sets the correct parameters in the Flash embed code. </p>
<p>If you use a modern non-Microsoft browser, likely you won't be affected. If you don't have Flash installed, this will definitely not affect you. </p>
