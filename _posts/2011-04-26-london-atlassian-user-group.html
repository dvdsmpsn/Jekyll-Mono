<p>Last Tuesday, I went down to the National Archives at Kew, attended the <a href="http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AUG/London+AUG+April+2011">London Atlassian User Group</a> and presented  a talk on "Confluence and Analytics". </p>
<p>In the morning there was a meet up with Atlassian plugin developers from all over northern Europe.  We discussed amongst other things Adaptavist's new plugin licensing system and <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/sleberrigaud/all-your-data-belong-to-us-the-active-objects-plugin">Active Objects</a> - a database independent sandboxed ORM plugin for all Atlassian products.</p>
<p>The afternoon was dedicated to the main user group event.  There were over 150 people in attendance. <!--more--> Introduced by Guy Fraser from Adaptavist, the meeting quickly split into a user and a technical track.   I stayed in the user track which consisted on a series of user case studies from organisations as diverse as <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk">the National Archives</a> (our hosts), <a href="http://www.stevesinnottfoundation.org.uk/">Steve Sinnott Foundation</a>, <a href="http://www.riskandsafetyplus.com/">Risk and Safety Plus</a> and <a href="http://www.nyk.com/english/group/europe.htm">NYL Line</a>. These were punctuated by plugin demonstrations from <a href="http://www.refinedwiki.com/">RefinedWiki</a>, <a href="http://k15t.com/">K15t Software</a> and my own talk representing <a href="http://www.affusions.com/">AppFusions</a>.</p>

<p>After all that talking, we adjourned to the <a href="http://www.kewgardenshotel.com/">Kew Gardens Hotel</a> for continued discussion and some welcome refreshments on such a sunny spring day.  It was a great opportunity to meet up with such a large group of developers and end users.  </p>
