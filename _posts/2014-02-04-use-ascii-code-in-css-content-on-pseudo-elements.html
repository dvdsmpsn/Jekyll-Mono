<p>I've been experiencing some oddities with character encoding when deploying code on a client system. I was in a bit of a rush and didn't have time to dig deeper.</p>
<p>Adding the "<b>&amp;#187;</b>" character to my CSS worked so worked nicely on my dev and test system:</p>
<pre><code>
#breadcrumbs li:before {<br />
    content: &quot;Â»&quot;;<br />
}<br />
</code></pre>
<p>But on deployment, I get the dreaded "<b>??</b>" output. Yuck. This is likely to be something to do with the build server or the client machine.</p>
<p>As a really quick workaround, replace the unicode with ASCII instead:</p>
<pre><code>
#breadcrumbs li:before {<br />
    content: &quot;&#92;&#48;0BB&quot;;<br />
}<br />
</code></pre>
<p>This just works no matter what. In future, it'll be ASCII all the way for me.</p>
