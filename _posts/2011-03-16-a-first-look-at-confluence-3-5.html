<p>A few days ago I got my hands on a copy of Confluence 3.5.  Atlassian are billing this as their "biggest release ever", and a casual glance at the <a href="http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Confluence+3.5+Release+Notes">release notes</a> suggests that this is true.   </p>
<p>There's a whole host of real improvements bundled with this release. </p>
<p>Here's a rundown of some of the stand out new features...<br />
<!--more-->
<ul>
<li>The ability to quickly create and link a JIRA issue from within a Confluence page</li>
<li>Improved AD & LDAP connections -- including nested LDAP groups (yes)</li>
<li>HTML5 drap & drop -- no more using Google Gears</li>
<li>Simpler ways to watch & share pages and blog post</li>
<li>A smarter slicker dashboard</li>
<li>Spaces now live in categories in the new Spaces Directory</li>
</ul>
<p>Perhaps my favourite new feature of all has been completely overlooked by most people -- thumbnail images can now handle transparencies.  This is a "<a href="http://blogs.atlassian.com/confluence/2011/01/size-doesnt-matter-small-improvements-35.html">small improvement</a>" that allows me to sleep a little easier. Yes. Really.</p>
<p>And here's the video tour:</p>
