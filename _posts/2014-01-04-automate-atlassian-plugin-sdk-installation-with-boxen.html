<p>It's easy to <a href="https://developer.atlassian.com/display/DOCS/Install+the+Atlassian+SDK+on+a+Linux+or+Mac+System">install the Atlassian Plugin SDK</a> on a Mac <b>once</b> using <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>:<br />
<code>brew tap atlassian/tap<br />
brew install atlassian/tap/atlassian-plugin-sdk<br />
</code></p>
<p>I've built and rebuilt Mac machines enough times to realise that it's wasted time starting from scratch even with some simple commands. </p>
<p>I don't want or need to remember what to install. Maintaining a list of what is needed for my dev machines isn't cool. I just want my development machine to install and configure itself. Auto-install all the browsers, editors, IDEs, productivity and virtualisation software with one command in a single go.</p>
<h2>Automate with Boxen</h2>
<p><a href="http://boxen.github.com/">Boxen</a> is a great way to quickly build a standard environment for your Mac machines. You can hit the ground running by creating your own copy of <a href="https://github.com/boxen/our-boxen">Our Boxen</a>, then personalise at will. There are an <a href="https://github.com/search?q=%40boxen+puppet-">absolute pile of Puppet modules</a> for most obvious software installs, so no need to reinvent the wheel there. For more bespoke stuff, you can <a href="https://github.com/search?q=%40dvdsmpsn+puppet-" title="well, quickly with the help of @sdh100shaun and his ruby/puppet knowledge">like me</a>, quickly build your own with the help of <a href="https://github.com/boxen/puppet-template">puppet-template</a>.</p>
<h2>But what about automating Atlassian Plugin SDK installation?</h2>
<p>Well, that's easy too. Boxen bundles Homebrew, so all you need to do is edit your <b><a href="https://github.com/boxen/our-boxen/blob/master/manifests/site.pp">manifests/site.pp</a></b> or <b>modules/people/manifests/your-github-username.pp</b> file and add this:</p>
<p>[code]<br />
  homebrew::tap { 'atlassian/tap': }</p>
<p>  package { &quot;atlassian/tap/atlassian-plugin-sdk&quot;:<br />
    ensure =&gt; present,<br />
    require =&gt; Homebrew::Tap['atlassian/tap'],<br />
  }<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>Then commit, push and run your <b>boxen</b>. You'll have the SDK installed at <b>/opt/boxen/homebrew/Cellar/atlassian-plugin-sdk/</b></p>
<p>Then you'll be ready to go. Simple. </p>
