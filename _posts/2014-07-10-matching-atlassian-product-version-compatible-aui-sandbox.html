<p>Or how to match an Atlassian product and version to a compatible AUI Sandbox.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.atlassian.com/aui/latest/sandbox/">AUI Sandbox (latest)</a> is really useful when fitting design patterns to Atlassian add-ons. </p>
<p>I keep hitting problems though. Paste some example markup into (say) a Confluence add-on using the latest version of Confluence and the UI doesn't always look the same. </p>
<p>Why's that? Well. The latest released version of Confluence doesn't use the latest version of AUI. That's expected I suppose, but damn, I want the correct version. How?</p>
<p>In the web console in your Atlassian product type <code>AJS.version</code> then take a look here &ndash; https://docs.atlassian.com/aui/ &ndash; for the closest fit. You'll be able to browse down the directory structure to a compatible AUI Sandbox. </p>
<p>Check out these retro versions of AUI Sandbox &ndash; <a href="https://docs.atlassian.com/aui/3.3.0/sandbox/sandbox.html">3.3.0</a>, <a href="https://docs.atlassian.com/aui/3.6.0/sandbox/">3.6.0</a> &amp; <a href="https://docs.atlassian.com/aui/4.0/sandbox/">4.0</a> &ndash; pretty wild, huh?</p>
