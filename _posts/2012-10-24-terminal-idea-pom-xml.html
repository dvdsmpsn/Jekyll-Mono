<p>I'm lazy. If I can shave a little time off mundane tasks, I'll try. One such task that's bothered me of late is opening a Maven project in Intelli-J.<br />
<!--more--><br />
This seems wasteful:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Intelli-J</li>
<li>File | Open Project</li>
<li>Shuffle around looking for the correct directory</li>
<li> Click OK</li>
</ol>
<p>I just want to type <strong>idea pom.xml</strong> in Terminal and have my IDE ready and waiting. </p>
<p>For example with TextMate, if I want to view the current project, I'll type <strong>mate .</strong> in Terminal and all is good. So why not just apply the same to Intelli-J?</p>
<p>How does the <strong>mate</strong> command work?  Well, it's essentially just an alias for <strong>open -a TextMate.app</strong></p>
<p>So the simple answer is... <strong>open -a IntelliJ IDEA 10.5.4.app pom.xml</strong></p>
<p>Hmmmm. That's a big command for a simple developer to remember. Which version of Intelli-J was I on again?</p>
<p>To sharpen this up, add an alias to <strong>~/.profile</strong></p>
<pre><code>
alias idea=&quot;open -a IntelliJ IDEA 10.5.4.app&quot;<br />
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can just use:</p>
<pre><code>
idea pom.xml<br />
</code></pre>
<p>If the project has already been imported into Intelli-J, you get this dialog:<br />
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/idea-dialog.png" alt="" title="idea-dialog" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1590" /></p>
<p>I can cope with that. It's already feeling a lot better. </p>
