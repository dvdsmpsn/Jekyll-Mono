<p>Atlassian released version 5.0.0 of their plugin SDK earlier this month and like a fanboy I upgraded immediately. It updates Maven from 2.1.0 to 3.2.1, so that's a big change in itself. </p>
<p>Today, I started work on updating an add-on for Confluence 4.3.x (yes, really). Guess what? My development environment is now completely incompatible with the target Confluence version. What to do?</p>
<p>Being a Homebrew fan, I'd like to use that to reinstall the old version. You can do this with old versions of some software such as Maven e.g.</p>
<pre><code>
brew tap homebrew/versions<br />
brew install maven2<br />
</code></pre>
<p>I'd like to do the same with the Atlassian Plugin SDK. Could I? Nope.</p>
<p>So I rolled my own. It was very easy. </p>
<p>You can use it too. Here's how:</p>
<pre><code>
brew tap dvdsmpsn/tap<br />
brew install dvdsmpsn/tap/atlassian-plugin-sdk-42<br />
</code></pre>
<p>This currently installs version 4.2.19 of the SDK. </p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dvdsmpsn/homebrew-tap">The code is available on GitHub.</a> I'm sure there are better ways of doing this, but it fills a gap and that's enough for me.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2014-06-18:</strong><br />
Atlassian have added <a href="https://github.com/atlassian/homebrew-tap/blob/master/atlassian-plugin-sdk4.rb">their own legacy version</a> just like mine. You can try it out:</p>
<pre><code>
brew tap atlassian/tap<br />
brew install atlassian/tap/atlassian-plugin-sdk-4<br />
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks to <a href="#comment-143277">Marcos Scriven</a> for providing the update and letting me know.</p>
