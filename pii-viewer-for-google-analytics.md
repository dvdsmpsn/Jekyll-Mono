**<abbr title="personally identifiable information">PII</abbr> Viewer for Google Analytics is a browser extension for Chromium-based browsers such as Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome. It allows you to map the user ID stored in Google Analytics to locally stored personally identifiable information (PII) such as name and email address.**

## How it works

Sending personally identifiable information (PII) to Google Analytics is strictly prohibited, but sending a unique user ID <em>is</em> in a custom dimension is permitted. This extension allows you to map the user ID stored in Google Analytics to locally stored PII such as name and email address.

Rather than building your own custom integration to map this data together, you can simply reference a locally stored CSV file (or use the in-built Mailchimp integration) and let this extension do the hard work. This means that you full comply with the Google Analytics privacy policy, but get to understand your visitor data.

**Update**

PII Viewer for Google Analytics now supports identifying users in [Behaviour Flow](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2785577?hl=en) and [Mailchimp integration](http://mailchimp.com/).
